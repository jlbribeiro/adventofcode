I chose to manually modify the `input` file from part 1 (`input_part1`) for part 2 (`input_part2`), to keep the test examples for part 2 "clean", based on the problem description; as most of the test cases provided for part 1 are not centered (i.e. invalid in the context of part 2), I chose to accept them after the transformation.

The alternative would be to accept both input formats (1 entry/before data correction AND 4 entries and walls/after data correction), which would imply distinguishing between both... didn't seem worth it.
