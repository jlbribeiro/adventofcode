Day 25/Part 1 is a [text adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction), so it was solved "manually"; the final part (determining the right items) could actually be programatically solved, but it was feasible (and fun) to do it like this.

`solution` contains the combination of items that, given my input, gave me access to the code.
