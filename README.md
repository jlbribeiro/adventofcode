# Advent of Code solutions

[@jlbribeiro](https://jlbribeiro.com) December's (somewhat productive)
procrastination: [Advent of Code][aoc].

This is not code that I'm particularly proud of: some of the solutions are OK,
others were _quick-and-dirty_ solutions to the problem (even if that meant
waiting for the output).

However, I feel I have to open-source this in order to help me overcome my
perfectionism and "code shyness".

**So here they are.**

Any suggestions are welcome.
